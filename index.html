                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">About History</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The project of translating the IBP Hindi Bible was formally declared opened on Tuesday, May 7, 1974, in New Delhi by the evangelical Christian leaders of India. In the beginning the project was called the New Hindi Bible Commission (NHBC). All the churches in India, particularly the evangelicals, were invited to send their representatives to discuss this important project. After several such meetings it was unanimously resolved that a completely new translation of the whole Bible should be taken up. Hence, the New Hindi Bible Commission was formed. The very people who had signed the declaration paper of the formation of the Society, later on became the founding members and the governing body of the India Bible Publishers.
<br>
<br>After numerous meetings, prayerfully, these members selected some well-known theologians, academicians, pastors, evangelists, translators, editors and the leaders of the evangelical beliefs from different churches and organizations of India. As per policy of India Bible Publishers, in order to give honour and glory only to God Himself, the names of the translators and editors are not made public here. However, to provide assurances of the reliability of this translation and its thoroughly evangelical underpinnings, the names of the translators and editors will be given to any one specifically requesting them, by writing to the Executive Secretary, IBP.
<br>
<br>Dr. Kenneth McVety, a man of God from The Evangelical Alliance Mission (TEAM), who at that time functioned as the Director of the Word of Life Press Ministries in Tokyo, Japan, was the main person to initiate this important project. He acted as our International Consultant. He functioned as the resource person in providing financial assistance to pay honorariums, travel expenses, local accommodations, etc. for the Hindi Bible translators to come to Delhi and to work on the translation verse by verse with the help of various dictionaries and commentaries. The translators were assigned separate portion to translate at home and then to bring the translation to New Delhi and Lucknow (India) for checking by the Central Checking Committee. They all were well equipped with necessary tools - the dictionaries, commentaries, concordances, lexicons and many other helpful books required - to translate accurately from the Original Greek and Hebrew into language that could be understood by common readers, keeping in view the dignity of the Word of God. In addition, the following English translations were referred to as the primary reference works: The American Standard Version (1911), the New American Standard Bible (1971) and the New International Version (1978).
<br>
<br>It will not be justified, if we don't at this juncture also mention a person, without whom we do not know exactly what would have been the fate of this project. It was none other but Mr. Dale R. Seefeldt, a linguist and an expert in Hebrews &amp; Greek with formal training and degree from the Wheaton College, IL, USA. Since he spent most of his early days with his missionary parents in India, he knew Hindi and some other Indian dialects quite well, which was very beneficial for this project. He was young, energetic, loving, jovial and over all, a very dedicated and hardworking person. He worked day and night with an editorial team, based in New Delhi, to get this project accomplished. We are grateful to the TEAM for supporting him for 14 years (1976 -1990) for this vital project in India.
<br>
<br>Finally, in the history of IBP, many Christians in Japan, especially the publishers of the New Japanese Bible, will not in a slightest way be forgotten for their perseverance and the extent to which they loved the Word of God and supported the project so sacrificially. Despite so many hurdles and hardships, these men and women of God never gave up, but prayerfully kept on supporting this project wholeheartedly, both morally and with their resources - until the project of Pavitra Bible was accomplished.
<br>
<br>The work thus continued in God's providence, and under God's help and provision we had the pleasure of releasing its first New Testament on May 1, 1982, at the YMCA, New Delhi. Later on in 1991, by God's grace the India Bible Publishers was able to complete the translation of the entire Bible, called the Pavitra Bible (Holy Bible). It was released on July 27, 1991, in New Delhi. This wonderful Bible has been widely accepted by all the churches, Christian organizations and numerous individuals. We just praise God for His mercy and grace, and all the provisions for this project.</p>
